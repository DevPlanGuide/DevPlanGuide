# What is it for?
Roles of Team lead, Tech lead, Manager are very broad. We have different tasks, work in different departments, have different level of accountability. In addition to this, we have our own management styles and differnet personalities. 

We identified some basic competencies of leaders and compile it together into the following map. 

You can use this map to create your own development plan, to draft job description, to draft job postings or to use during interviews or Check Ins. You might not need all branches and that's okay. 

> üö® **Important:** Depending on the function leader needs to work on different branches and competencies. It does not mean that the final goal is development in all branches as per this map. Primarily you need to pay attention on problems at your workplace and your needs. 
Work in progress, don't hesitate to suggest new branches, ask questions, and participate in discussions. 

# How to use?
## üìöTo create development plan
1. Download [–∫–∞—Ä—Ç—É](https://tlroadmap.io/roadmap-ru.mm) the mind map. 
2. Review all branches. Cross out all branches what it not applicable to you or these responsibilities are already perfromed by other people. Leave those what is expected from you and those what you want to develop. 
3. Show map what you would get to your peers, direct reports and manager and get feedback - what they want to see in you and what problems they see. 
4. Make self-assessment taking into account your weakness and feedback received, compare known facts with examples of bad and good behavior in chosen branch. 
5. Make prioritied list for your development points. 
6. Start to work out on the branches what helps to close out your gaps using the advices and materials in sections "Theory" and "Practice" in chosen branch. 

## üìöTo have awareness of leaders competencies
1. Open [–∫–ª–∏–∫–∞–±–µ–ª—å–Ω—É—é –≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—é —Ä–æ–∞–¥–º–∞–ø–∞](https://tlroadmap.io/roadmap-ru.svg).
2. Click on interesting for you branches. In database most of them are very detailed - description, motivation, examples of bad and good behavior, ways to develop. 
3. If you want to dive deeper, use section "Theory" in order to use outside materials better describing this branch.

## üó∫To define your responsibilities
1. Download [Mindmap](https://tlroadmap.io/roadmap-ru.mm) with full map.
2. Together with your manager and other interested persons adapt the map to your situation - cross out unnecessary branches, what is not expected from you. Try to minimize the number of branches and leave only those what you need, not what you might need theorectically. 
3. Use map what you would get in order to request feedback about your performance, monitor changes and track your responsibilities. You can use it to explain what you are accountable for to your team and to customers. 

## üí∞To hire leaders (internally or externally)
1. Download [Mindmap](https://tlroadmap.io/roadmap-ru.mm) with full map. 
2. Leave branches what would be mandatory to perform for potential candidate. 
3. Create job posting what would include elements from map what you would get. 
4. Create interview plan what you would follow to check candidate experience in different branches. Sections with examples of behavior and "Ways to develop" might help.  –ø—Ä–æ–∫–∞—á–∫–∏".

# Work in progress
Current map is not final and knowledge database would be replenished, and structure of the branches is updating periodically. We would be happy with your participation in this project.
